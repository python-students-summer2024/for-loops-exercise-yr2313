def calculate_infections(starting_number_infections, reproduction_rate, num_days):

    Write a function that predicts the approximate number of infected individuals from a socially-transmitted viral infection after a given number of days.
    Assume that, once infected, individuals stay infected indefinitely.
    You must use a for loop to progressively calculate the number of infections each day until the target number of days is reached.

    :param starting_number_infections: The number of infected individuals to begin with.
    :param reproduction_rate: A floating point number indicating the rate of growth in the number of infections each day.
    :returns: The new number of infected individuals after the given number of days, rounded to the nearest integer.
